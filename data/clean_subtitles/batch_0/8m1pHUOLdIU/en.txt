hello everyone will comes back so today so quick chatty video so I can publish this video tonight so first I want to talk about my current health situation and if you don't know what I'm talking about you can check out the links down in the description box description box and secondly a lot of you guys are going through the same issue as well I have so many comments in those videos like bloating as well you know my friends are making fun of me my family is making fun of my bloating I don't know what to do and you know you just want some help I totally understand why you guys are going through because I have bloating and cramping issues since I was at a very very young age since I could remember I had anybody since I was born so what do I expect my god hell is completely destroyed pretty much so I've never really done anything about it because I used to think that that was normal but this year I'm so determined and so positive that I can fix this problem and so guys hanging that if you have bloating issues like it takes time like some people are gonna take a couple of months maybe it's gonna take six months but we're gonna get there eventually so don't lose hope okay going back to the first thing here's my health update so when I first started this got protocol to fix my c-boy and just like other issues in my gut I I was so positive like I thought I was gonna be fixed in a month I want to be completely honest with you guys that I was really disappointed after a month but a whole entire month I was going through really bad cramping and bloating issues I've talked about it in my previous health update video and I don't really want to bore you guys with all the details but basically I was bedridden for so many weeks and after a month I was like oh my god like I just couldn't wait to finish a protocol and continue with my life you know like do things that I used to be able to do and after boys I after a month I still couldn't do much I was still feeling so fatigued on my fifth week I was my bloating was not getting any better anyway I had consultation my doctor and turned out that I have more than just see boy we're still trying to figure out my problems so I don't really want to go to like all the details about it yet until we figure out what the heck is the problem so still trying to figure it out but not losing hope and I don't want anyone to feel bad for me I'm feeling a lot happier and I'm a lot more positive right now like I can at least do some bodyweight workouts you know I have my energy back right now like I feel pretty good so yeah after a month on my fifth week I'm still feeling really crappy like I'll still having lots of bloating issues and my fart oh my goodness guys it was smelly I've never had such bad buzz before my life was horrible okay I know this is TMI whatnot but because the bacteria is just like dying and producing a lot of toxins in my body and that's why I was having so much die-off symptoms it was like probably just you know trying to get out of my body all my six weeks that's when I started feeling a lot better and on that way I saw my doctor as well and he told me that it could be more than just evil in my situation if you have got issues that for example for me I have been suffering for this for like 30 years I can't expect to fix it within a month I was being way too unrealistic with my expectation is at the same time sorry you know like this is probably gonna take me like more than a month well three months who knows I I hope that I can be fixed within three months I'm really positive still that I can be fixed in three months so after I talk to him he'd think that I have other like health problems it could be hernia it could be low stomach acids it could be a stress-related issues like it could be other issues so yeah I'm not losing hope guys I'm still working with my doctor about this you know give you guys a better update in the future once yeah I figure out what my problem is so yeah I don't want you guys to feel bad for me I'm not really feeling bad for myself anymore no victim here okay this is just some sort of health issues but for those of you guys who are watching this video and think that bloating is nothing so like I say in my previous video this difference between like just building from eating foods and also like severe and chronic cramping which is what love us are suffering from so the positive thing is that my SIBO is probably almost gone because I'm not bloating as much as before like after the six weeks now right now is I'm all my seven or eight week by now seventh week I'm not feeling as bloated as before but I still have loading I know some of you guys are gonna be like oh I just saw your plank it is you look pretty like you know lean so I have to record my videos before I eat anything I just don't think anyone would watch someone that's really bloated you know like doing workout videos so that's the current situation right now I still bloat from eating not so much cramping anymore so I'm really really happy about that and also I got pretty much my energy back I'm feeling a lot more energetic right now as you can see seriously Khloe get together the negative thing is that I can't eat love food right now I have lots of bloating from just eating different our foods so I have to be very careful with what I eat right now my doctor and I were trying to work out what the problem is I don't know how long this is gonna go for it so I hope I really really hope that it's gonna get fixed soon so now I'm gonna share some information about the things I've learned through my doctor and also just true this experience you know and again I'm not a doctor so I do seek medical advice from a doctor or natural Popham functional medicine doctor yes it can be quite expensive but your long-term health is so valuable sorry yeah anyway here's all the things that could possibly lead to bloating so what other causes of bloating is parasites a lot of us like I believe you're not like about 25 cents per parasites and I did my parasites plans last year before I did all this gut protocol because I just want to make sure like you know the parasites gone and I saw some bloody worms in my poop it was and that's these guys so that's the reason why when I did my stool test I didn't have parasites anymore because they're worth going and I was really happy that they were gone they were in my poop it was frickin disgusting by the way that's gone that's good and the second reason could be c-boy which is what I was going through more intestinal bacterial overgrowth so that's basically too much excess bacteria in your small intestine you're not supposed to have that much bacteria in a small intestine and I had way too hard she could just watch so much bloating in my god and I hope feeling that my SIBO is probably clear or maybe not 100% clear I'm gonna do another test just a check just to check whether there's any more or less number three is probably low stomach acid and which is why I had love in digestion so about 10 years ago I saw my local doctor and he prescribed me aunty acid or entire see I was taking that for about a year or so because I used to have really bad acid bugs and little I know I I was probably low in stomach acid and I was taking all these things to make my asset level in my stomach even lower sorry my bloating issue is really really bad and I was having a lot of cracks as well so like I said my bloating and cramping issues started a long time ago so I guess that causes more bloating and in digestion and it was just adding up man it's antibiotics anti-acids rakete I don't know what the heck I did to my stomach man number four is overgrowth a lot of people who have like bacterial overgrowth in their stomach has you know a chance of having yeast overgrowth as well I don't think I had that dough so at least I didn't have that very good in the next possible reason that causes bloating is hydro hernia again I don't really know how to pronounce this word but after speaking to my doctor he thought that there's a chance that I might have died as well but it is gonna be very expensive to get myself checked for that you gotta go to endoscopy gonna see a GI specialist so I haven't done that yet if I'm not getting any better in three months I'll get myself checked but that is one possibility because I was having a lot in digestion and I just couldn't digest like even smoothie Stiles having quite a bit of problems like from smoothies like seriously so yeah that's a possibility so another couple causes of bloating could be because yeah you have celiac disease so you can't digest gluten or it could be other sort of intolerance or endometriosis endometriosis and also I guess just like us heaps of other digestive related issues as well another very possible reason that causes building is stress I've seen a lot of comments in my videos that are you have said that stress causes bloating as well so stress could be one of them and I do live a pretty stressful lifestyle I really want to take care of myself a little bit better it's a lot of things going on and I don't really want to talk about it in this video so yeah stress can cause bloating as well because it's causing quite a lot of information and especially if you have I got issues it's gonna cost more information you've got exposed obviously yeah probably a lot of other reasons but these are just some of the more common causes of floating that I know of I could be suffering from a couple of them which is why it is a little bit difficult to to fix this current situation you know but it's okay guys I know it will get better so I'm just gonna give you guys a couple tips and advice when it comes to you know bloating first thing is to have a foot diary I know this is super basic and so simple you must be thinking like seriously Chloe foot diary are you serious so guys ever since I started my foot diary I finally can take care of my booty issue a little bit better because it's a lot that I'm just not tolerant off right now right now just right now so for example I can't really have raspberries and blackberries right now like Direction is pretty immediate when it comes to raspberries and blackberries with me so the reason why I can't have it is because they have all these little seeds in them they are great five hours great insoluble fibers pick up you know build up to bulk up your stool but the bacteria in my gut loves to feed on it and produce a lot of guests and causes a lot like cramping so I thought that for example avocado actually I knew about avocado like I just I was in denial I just didn't want to believe that allergic to avocado not allergic intolerant I like to say what intolerant I'm not allergic because I can still eat it I'm not gonna dive on any avocado but I'll feel a lot bloating and you know just uneasiness okay so having a foot diary is really great because you don't really know why it's 2 or 3 days ago so try to think about why you ate 2 or 3 days ago and try to remember every single thing you ate including like spices or milk or what not or what type of sugar you use sometimes you don't get the foot Direction up about two or three days so then it would be great for you to look back like okay so what did I eat two days ago that causes this lethargic feeling that you're feeling right now so number two is to get yourself tested so obviously start with your food diary first because that's well free and then you can do some sort of like stool test if you think you have parasites or bacterial overgrowth you know stool test is really good or you can try to do organic acid test and that's basically looking at your urine or you can do a saliva test to check your hormones maybe that that does stress-related so I'm off to test a little bit more expensive and some not so I feel that all the saliva and blood tests are not she expensive and I got a referral letter to see a GI specialist a couple months ago but I wanted to try you know to see a natural pub or functional medicine doctor first before I go into that route because I really really don't want to insert a camera down my throat or down my butt up my butt tell my buddy oh I really don't want to do that that is my last resort so yeah this is a lot of things you can do to help with your bloating issues a lot of people think that bloating issues is just because they eat too much or you have too much chocolates but some people do have like you know some sort of digestive dysfunction so yeah if you think you have one of those problems you know talk to your family talk to your doctor anyway don't lose hope guys I hope this video helps you out and don't forget to smash that like button anyway hope you guys have a great day and I'll see you guys in the next video bye

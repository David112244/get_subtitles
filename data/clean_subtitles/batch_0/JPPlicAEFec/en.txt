and my little kid is crazy about it yeah i do this things like that he loves it i'm going to do more of this wim hof thank you for coming on under the skin right on we gave it some skin at the river yeah i've never uh you know so just so that the people listening are up to speed we just swam in the river thames together it's not super cold certainly not for you for you that's you probably barely noticed but for me i felt my testicles plunge initially to sub-zero temperatures they would have been like a couple of zeros and then i felt them very very hot and powerful afterwards when we were in that water i said to you what do i do where should i put my attention and you said nowhere exactly that's why it should be you know sometimes you just need to let go and the body is able to solve it all what we do is we are we're wearing clothes all the time we are de-stimulating the the elements of nature on our body and we therefore think so much and it's like unstoppable and where are the sensations to the body it's not there yet we have three times the world's length of vascular channels inside of us and they are composed with millions of little muscles if they are not stimulated through the cold and heat and the elements of nature then it gets weaker and guess what what is killer number one what kills millions of people uh every year is cardiovascular related diseases how come get into the rhythm teams swim and take it on you you go out with your dog don't you it needs to pee and run and this and that we are mammals we should get out with the dog and into the water because it it really is a vascular fitness uh workout we have insulated ourselves from nature from our own human nature and from our environment i think you know the difference between a human being as they could be and a human being as they are is the difference between a free bird in a forest and a battery hen whose energy is used entirely for industry for commodification for produce just in case whim anyone listens to this doesn't know much about you but i'm sure everyone does because you've been most popular guest we've had lots and lots and lots of requests for you uh you've you hold the world record for the farthest swim under ice you reach the top of mount kilimanjaro within two days wearing only shorts and what interest me uh the thing that i really enjoyed the documentary about you i believe vice made where i saw you being injected under clinical conditions scientifically observed injected with bacteria and able through breath techniques to control your immune system and fight off this bacterial infection the the the main the the sort of i suppose the point of entry for understanding wim hof is that through breath through consciousness you can control the body to a degree not imagined before perhaps except in yogic or buddhist or deep deep christian and islamic traditions the mind can control the body to a degree we didn't anticipate and this has been scientifically proven through your work yes six years ago we had a comparative study to show that the autonomous autonomous is outside of our will it's no longer outside of our will this autonomous nervous system related to the innate immune system specific immune system and endocrine system the hormonal system you know what if we feel bad it's because we have a lack of dopamine is a serotonin dopamine level within the brain cells is suddenly too low and then you feel depressed can you do something about it no because it is autonomous i tell you right now we found a way to tap into the autonomic nervous system so at that time six years ago nobody believed really what i was doing they tested me but i'm the iceman i can do special things he is the ice man he's a brother of batman and superman and he is the iceman of course i was running marathons beyond the polar circle in shorts going up mount everest to the death zone in my shorts and going under the eyes and all those things i many records i did many challenges and then the scientists began to see hey but what this man is doing is physiologically not possible according to our signs and what has been written down but he is doing it and he is a human let's test them so they tested me they for 80 minutes they had me in in ice they took my blood and then the blood they exposed it to endotoxin that's a e coli bacteria which normally creates a very violent reaction on the immune cells even in the in the blood serum with my blood zero reaction that means zero inflammation zero inflammatory markers within the blood what is disease it's inflammation inflammation is the cause and effect of disease now this guy is showing zero reactions what is going on uh but he is the uh ice man he is an exception that confirms the rule so hey that's it and that's that he's a freak of nature i tell you i'm not i'm uh one of the twins identical and my twin brother is not able to do what i do why because i jump into the river attempts i let my body out together with my dog my i'm the mammal i i get into nature and that made me into a deeper level of my physiology awakened to my mind but nobody knew about that so i said to these doctors what i can do anybody can do it's only training it's only awakening because it's already there everybody is innately capacitated to rule over his autonomic nervous system his uh uh uh the healing of the body is within your command i mean i don't see hospitals in rabbit uh world or the wolves or the elephants only it's not there and there are no hospitals there are no psychiatric asylums or anything uh there is no pharmacy they deal with that themselves because every mammal is innately capacitated to heal himself to be in connection with the specific immune system we lost it because we wear clothes all the time we are de-stimulated within our own physiology and it's not answering because there is no question the question the triggers are gone the body is responding so all this vascular system which is composed with millions of little muscles they are very much connected to the cells and their reactions these cells are there and innately capacitated to respond to adapt to the situation and to keep equilibrium balance within it all so there they came sorry but the doctors came and they said okay you say that everybody is able to do that they took on the challenge can you because if you are able to bring people into this control you have shown in a scientific experiment then we have scientific evidence that we are able as humans uh to go into the autonomic nervous system immune system in the deepest and the endocrine system that means we change the perspective of what humans are capable of against disease both physical and mentally not little bit big time but before that how much time do they need to train with you one year one half year i said ten days it became four days in four days i brought him uh to the top or without former experience in the cold in short to the top of a mountain in poland and it's funny almost because we went up the slope it was minus ten and one and a half hours so we had to go to the ridge which is the the border of uh czechia and poland and then these ninja uh dressed like military people with guns they came over the ridge and they saw a group of people in their shorts coming up and it was minus 13 degrees celsius already so uh i told these guys in the beginning to change their mindset hey guys you are the new gladiators you are going to win the greatest war ever of the most of misery and agony that one of the bacteria and the virus four days later they were on the on the flanks on the on the on the shore of the of the mountain to the rich minus 13 we came across these people that was funny we made selfies in the end but then we went on to the top and at the top it was -27 there we danced the harlem shake all in shorts minus 27 and i knew they are there where mother nature meant to be four days later they were in the hospital and they showed after sixteen thousand hundred and thirty four uh test subjects been experimented on with the same e coli bacteria all becoming sick like fever headaches not nice time it's a controlled experiment but they haven't got a nice step and they get some you know 400 euros all of them so uh yeah for that they do it and um so 16 134 people were being tested and they all became sick and now suddenly 12 people were very able 100 percent score to control the bacteria being injected within a quarter of our there we changed science we changed the perspective of science the autonomic nervous system endocrine system and the uh immune system are no longer not accessible very deeply accessible so what this experience demonstrates is that to the immune system and the various anatomical systems that you have described the experience of extreme cold and the experience of an invading bacteria or an invading virus is seen as the same thing something that can be repelled and controlled all right simply stress and you no far from being an anomaly as the ice man the uh the beautiful moniker that you have taken on been given you are able to teach these techniques to anybody so there are two things excuse me that i'd really like to know one is how did you i did my burp over there i turned away from the mic you immediately one second later did a burp down the mic what kind of mind game is that whim [Laughter] it's a good game it's like synchronicity it's coming together it's sharing we are tribal we're in a sealed space we're burping ourselves to the next dimension exactly exactly exactly so it's a burp away transcendence is just a purple way so whim like there's two things that i want to know one what are the techniques that can activate these systems that teach the body to deal with stress in a different way whether it's climbing up a mountain in a pair of shorts and making friends with border patrol garden ninjas or repelling e coli injected into the bloodstream what is it that you activate and how do you do it yeah it's actually very simple um and we got it on our website it's very for free it's an app you take it down and you learn the basics very much endorsed by millions of data of scientific technique basically breathing technique well you know what what do you do when you go into the cold the first thing you breathe deep yeah how difficult is that this is what we do not do anymore because we wear clothes we are de-stimulated you seem like a man whose only motivation in life is to get everyone naked which used to be how i lived i love that i love that there's uh over exaggeration of uh clothes and uh you know high heels you know it's kind of nice but hey the thing is so we've become desensitized because we're living like this but and this is a very simple breath technique that you can teach everyone how did you discover that you could do this um yeah years of looking uh there is more than meets the eye and i became a sort of a debater philosopher looking into esoteric disciplines and and all the yoga and the kung fu and the japanese and the sanskrit and all those things that's what you were interested in this stuff for years yes i was i was just because of curiosity yes yes curiosity is the best drive the finder the the seeker becomes the finder in the end but for that you need an inquisitive nature and that is a part of the condition ways we have we are schooled in and um yeah and getting conditioned because you describe this stuff you use very scientific language necessarily because i think if you're talking about something as profound as being able to repel disease or withstand extreme temperatures people don't want to think of it as something yogic or woo-woo they want to think of it as something scientific something pragmatic and practical but you always had the curiosity you said about kung fu about yoga about various techniques that are about i suppose mind over matter when did you what was it that what was your breakthrough when you realized you could control a simple morning uh sunday morning it was i was pondering in the park there was the water nobody was around because it's sunday morning and there was a thin layer of ice on the water and just got felt attracted i went into the water and uh yeah i got an answer from inside it said yes it felt so good and i felt the power while i was into the ice water i could stay and i i i i see it in front of me right now like i was wondering why i didn't feel any pain and i could play with a thin layer of ice like very subtle that was this wondering and then i went out i felt the rush it felt great all day so the other day i came back and uh do the same and i felt the same and i felt so good and when you feel good about something you always come back so that's what i did i became conscious of my breathing it was deeper it was different and when i was going more profound into my body through the breathing i could do like 25 don't do this at home because i did it gradually huh it was very dangerous if you do this directly but i was able to do a uh in 25 deep breaths while being immersed in the cold ice cold water i became so charged the carbon dioxide out oxygen in different processes start up in the inside of the body became not only impervious to the cold the last breath after the 25 always after the 25 boolean hold go five to seven minutes under the water and like every day very controlled very still in the mind the only thing you could hear down there in the fetus position i always was very still fetus uh what that is and then the last half minute is always polluted by having a pee the kidneys yeah it's like dying or something uh something like adrenaline comes because there's a lack of uh the right chemistry in the body and that inaugurates the moment of going out slowly but surely this is what i did every day and it brought my bodies power to my attention and then i saw oh this breathing then i began to separate the breathing of the cold and i did that at home you started to do these breathing techniques of these deep breaths that you then hold in yes you start to do it away from the water yes what were you exploring then no intention or just you're just curious just curiosity and feeling good about it and and i saw all the the chakras what do you mean you saw them you know yeah lights yes i saw them all you saw them yeah they did it oh yes oh yes oh no problem it's all there it's electricity and once you are able to uh manipulate the uh the nervous system uh pneumatically you are able to activate it activates boom boom boom boom and they become visual it's nothing esoteric about it can you describe to me what you s when you say you saw the chakras what were you where were you seeing them you were closing your eyes you close your eyes you see it all is a very beautiful penetrating yet very soft to light and it's beautiful it's three-dimensional and you transform inside the body becomes electric you feel it you feel it and uh it's amazing it's amazing but like anything else at a certain moment after years we get bored with it you get more i got bored like hey there is more i got into these techniques and i saw it all and i could uh yeah the the the noise in the brain it changes three times and you get the thousand belts that's the sahasrara as i as we know in yoga and then you got these layers of the samadhi describing the tattoos that are on my arm of the chakras and you're saying that through deep meditative techniques achieved through controlled breathing you can physically experience these archetypal and essential energies which a lot of people that use the scientific type of language that you use would disregard as nonsense but i'm very curious as to how you for your own personal mission for your own personal yogic journey have discovered information that has been written about has been spoken of before that when they we talk of the yogis and the rishis in vedic literature going into states of consciousness and coming back with new information about how to control the body's energy systems it seems to me that you are doing this again now that that you know the point the point of the spiritual life is to feel good and many of us in contemporary social systems do not feel good because we are disconnected and we have allowed our personal being to become controlled by systems that do not have our best interests at heart that simply want us to be units of commodified energy that are not free so the first like these techniques first of all gave you access to sort of information that's you know you said not in an esoteric way but in a very real practical way do you you now believe from you know from what's been demonstrated through your own personal ability to withstand extreme temperatures your own personal ability to withstand the introduction of viruses into your body and then your ability to teach others that this will become more specific more thorough for example do you think it'd be possible for people with depression to control the amount of dopamine or serotonin that's in their systems through different techniques oh yes absolutely the last uh very very nice to mention you and to show you uh arm and you got all the chakras over there the yes yeah they are all over there and uh and with that the uh the elements you know pretty vijala the fire and then the vaju the the air and then you get the antagarana the thinking brain so all that uh i know i know all the sanskrit all about it and uh did you know that before you did this stuff uh no no after after and like parallel about that i thought it was so awkwardly written and so inaccessible and what is it what is it not i don't know there was still a lot of confusion until i got into the cold water and there i found a connection and then i found the connection that uh the breath was able to make me more powerful using the cold as a stressor to learn to equalize the power i could stay for longer and longer at a certain moment i could stay all the night out in short in freezing temperatures and feel good that is the power of breath breath is the life force only you have to connect it with your consciousness with your awareness you will you will it's like a baby a a little baby slags there's nothing wrong with it but still not able to walk it needs neurological connection so we need neurological connection with the breath in order to elevate this consciousness this awareness perception now they saw a perception we got not five senses we got eight senses they through all kinds of devices they have seen different neurological networks i mean visual cortex is a neurological network but the sex science is also a neurological network the seventh sense also in the eighth sense what are the objects of these senses the the objects of the sixth sense is the accessibility of the will to be able to go in any place of the brain that is going into the subconscious and the consciousness is the sixth sense it gives you absolute confidence to go your path whatever is your part doesn't matter if you you are able at a certain moment from going from time space ego into the uh uh uh all the parts of the brain which is the subconscious and consciousness when it's necessary and the brain knows and the subconscious knows then it leaves you alone you are without stress you are a very confident man or woman human number seven number seven the proprioception a neurological network that connects the will with the uh a specific immune system in the deepest with that we are able to get rid of disease in any way or to heal there from or prevent but we need to find this a connection we have shown this in six years ago with a group of people to be able within a quarter of an hour to tap into the proprioception into this network at will and the bacteria had no chance after sixteen thousand hundred and thirty four people why were they testing it before ah why did they test it so deeply before with sixteen thousand people what were they trying to demonstrate at that point trying to find a way to battle inflammation and what were they using pharmaceuticals or no they were you out they uh of course they pharmaceuticals they have done a lot of studies to make money to sell so and then comes a natural way which is only by accident because there's no money behind so what happens when you under clinical conditions demonstrate the power of the mind to repel disease to confront stress what happens to the people that have supported these studies do they say oh this is brilliant now what we can do is we can shut down pfizer and glaxo industries and we can all manufacture the necessary medicines within our bodies or that is the thing i think the science now is quite sort of not corrupted but so linked with money and research money for research and uh we all need to make money and also doctors etc that they do not truly are necessarily into finding uh ways of healing uh the people in natural ways but making money yes so that is the establishment people need to bring bread on the table as they say in the netherlands here in england we say that in england yeah go put bread on the table right on the table exactly that's money uh things are not really interesting how do you get your money since it's just a little side street because i want to talk about the number eight neurological network that is the imperial reception which lately i showed brain scans having control top down by the will over the body that is a step beyond disease is what is happening in nature and you have control over what is uh uh what what a stressor is doing uh on your body and that could be cold heat emotion anything uh and there was it was not known that we have a top down possible control so from the will into the body in tail reception uh we get into that meaning that you can with your own will decide right now i am going to not experience this heat or i i'm not going to experience this cold or i'm not going to experience this violence yes sort of or make the deepest part of the brain at work at will enabling this deepest part of the brain the endocannabinoid system and opioids the periaqueductal gray hemisphere it's a part of the uh brain stem if that is going to work then it deals with whatever stress is coming to your body from the inside out do you use this in a practical daily way say for example you felt afraid or intimidated or under some kind of threat have you got examples of doing that in your own life yeah i i deal with stress in many ways like everybody so i'm a family father of six and uh i got a dog and two chickens and uh and fish and uh three turtles and so when these are they need maintenance and all this and uh when those turtles [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sometimes i get stressed about it right time to bring in the system yeah it was it was uh only when these professors they came to me a psychiatrist uh professors and they told me asked me if i was willing to be subdued in an experiment uh in a model they developed and this model was to bring stress uh onto the body cold into a vest when was this uh two years ago two years ago two years ago in february is this in germany or america michigan michigan detroit and uh wayne state university school of medicine there uh they put me into a brain scan and in a brain scan you are not able to move and uh it's like an mri is it mri yes fmri and brain scan fmri is more the body and a brain scan is the brain so they put me in the boat a couple of times and um they had 74 people before that one and a half year was a study already ongoing 74 people uh have been tested with the perfusion vest which is a vast firefighters use underneath their equipment to keep cool so it has tubes inside with cold water they pumped cold water into the perfusion first and then it goes back and because the body wants to get warm or something they cool it down and keep their own cooling so what normally shown is that the people with 74 people all showed that the skin temperature was going down when it was cold warm when going uh uh up cold warm cold whoa those are the graphics then they looked inside the brain and that what is dealing with the stress is the prefrontal cortex was very uh activated in in their cases and at insula for example when you do deep meditation for a long time then the insulin gets this uh euphoric state activation so then you lose prefrontal cortex is going lower it's like blue color when euphoria is there because then the insula is working it gets up and uh in all the cases this was very activated and this was very low like red and this was blue and there was no other activation in the brain this was dealing with the direct stress coming in this is what they saw in the brain then they took me and when i did nothing the same graphics they saw the same graphics the prefrontal cortex very activated and the insula very little activated like everybody else so and then they asked day three whim now today you have to do what the iceman is doing the your meditation i don't know what i'm doing i just do it it's like in the water what do you think of yeah don't think that baby just be you know just do it and i all these moments on mount everest and the kilimanjaro in the marathons under the eyes losing my way under the ice hanging by one finger in mid-winter between hot air balloons extremes and they're staying for two hours and eyes and all feeling fine i was hey i gotta do that what i always did but now it's not nature around me it's a brain scan but i knew what to do i had the confidence i had click oh yeah that's it so i went they put me in the brain scan and uh they pumped the cold water in but my skin temperature did not go down anymore and like eight times and coming and going like cold warm cold warm had no effect i was one degree up and i stayed over there cold or impervious and not moving no contraction of muscles no deep breathing because you cannot do that you see a blurred images on the monitor so you i was not allowed to do anything just by thought and then they looked inside the brain they saw very little activation of the prefrontal cor cortex like blue no activation very red like in insula very high up like i was in euphoria i was warm the water was warm it had never been called to my ear to to me and and then they saw something they never had seen before and that was the activation of the periaqueductal gray hemisphere which is the deepest part of the brain stem the crocodile mind the reptilian brain we have no control over why because we never go like cold warm no we are into this de-stimulative behavior and all the people they lose their connections because it's not necessary to uh it is no need for the periaqueductal now the periaqueductal gray hemisphere is the residence of our opioids and endocannabinoids the cannabinoids euphoria nice feeling like hashis like a nice wheat pot or whatever it is called you feel wow they're great they are activated at that moment uh within our system but we got we got this t-shirt it says get high high on your own supply it's there it's there for us all so they saw me uh activating that robustly and then they said we found the key components of the autonomous processes in the brain thought of inaccessible by humans now uh accessible of our conscious brain related to mood regulation and mood regulation mood is anything is emotion could be through cold stress heat stress emotional stress daily stress all those things and then they said this is a transformational technique that will change mental health care but how long will it take that it gets to the people who need it my assumption is that because you have spent all that time practicing the with the you know clear and more physical conditions of exposure to cold you have learned how to activate you said the insular aspect of your brain it's not consciousness in this case it's your brain it's a physical measurable thing so that when you are required to access it you can i felt that so that's you have a form of practice fascinating that you could access that crocodile mind it makes me feel that perhaps the way that um our brains have evolved is in you know obviously any kind of evolution is by its nature incremental but it seems that what must have happened with human beings is that part of the mind this crocodile mind where the opioids you said were my ears pricked up at that point whim let me tell you where the opioid receptors are stored this part of the mind must not because it's formulated so far as uh separated by such distance of time from the the conscious mind that most of us occupy the relationship between these two parts of the brain has not been correctly formulated and because we live in these uh lives where we are encouraged to live on one particular frequency we don't know how to travel between these parts of consciousness now when i think of the mystical role of the shaman the shaman is the member of the tribe that can travel between levels levels of consciousness the shaman is the member of the tribe that knows how to access the crocodile mind the insula knows how to go between these levels and how do we see shaman represented in tribal cultures as different totemic animals they know how to access different parts of the animal mind i like this so for me these practices that you are developing is a kind of a new shamanism a new way of accessing different parts of the brain you know obviously the relationship between the conscious consciousness and the brain is a strong one but it suggests to me that there is a relationship between consciousness and the body if um you know the skin temperature wasn't altering so it feels to me that you know when if you were to try to uh if you which obviously is your mission to popularize these techniques so as many people as possible have access to them it seems likely that before we could get to the point where we are able to regulate and control our own dopamine that we would have to go on a process of learning these more basic forms of control would that be correct yes i i always say make it simple a a a cold shower a day keeps the doctor away that's it start having cold showers yeah that's it and take a warm one uh later but first a cold one you know what happens when you first take a cold one i need to go into the stress yeah no you activate your conscious brain into the brainstem i had my my uh personal experience of what you were describing and what you have mastered was one time i jumped into a very cold pond in someone's garden just to experience it and like you say i gasped and stuff and once i was in the water i was thinking my god my body is designed to be able to cope with this and i'm never letting my body experience it so i'm living in just one room in the mansion i'm not exploring the other rooms in the mansion i'm not opening the doors i'm not looking at what's accessible exactly you know what happens is because we think so much on this one level way of using our brain that's the neocortex it gets 25 percent more blood flow the rest is getting 24 uh 25 percent less it's not it's like surviving it's not blooming it's not able to be connected with because the right biochemistry is not there so in case when people get out of balance like a dopamine serotonin which is inside our brain cells when that happens we don't know how to bring the blood flow over there you go into cold showers it's not about toughness no it's about bringing the blood flow right in the brain stem and with that it passes the mid brain which is the mammalian brain which is the feeling and that feeling suddenly gets the right biochemistry and then you are able with your will which is a neurological muscle to of course you like to bring balance to the biochemistry and accordingly the the dopamine and the serotonin which is a natural thing to be but we denaturalized by bringing 25 more over there on a regular basis and we we survive we go win us but when the problem when the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hits the fan we don't know how to get a in there and bring balance so if you go into the cold shower and deal with the cold and or do these breathing techniques then you go into the deepest and with that it activates the right biochemistry and it needs to pass the midbrain you'd get not 20 you get 100 of the brain activation and we have shown that in the late last study with hanover in the one of the two best brain scans of the world they saw it was disco in like doing these breathing techniques they said germans say it's disco now you know germans dancing and yeah a little bit like wood but hey it was this girl and he said 100 of the brain was working that is biochemistry and that is what we're where we miss out on through our destinative comfort zone behaviorism so through these techniques we're not just talking about the mind we're talking about the brain aspects of the brain parts of the brain are lighting up that are not normally lighting up yes through doing this we're accessing of course the brain's biochemistry we're getting access to healing and a totally different perspective on the world what are the healing and feeling yes yes healing and feeling i love that little phrase i'm going to write it on my pad but what how is it what do you think is the impact on your intellect you know i spoke once to a man called ed stafford he's a sort of a survivalist he used to be in the marines or sas you know he's a hard guy and like he became he likes to survive in extreme environments and he once spent six months alone on an island before he went he spoke to these aboriginal men and he said but he said the main thing they taught him was he said he said we in our culture we believe we have three brains the brain of the belly this is the main brain the brain of the heart this is the second brain the brain of the head he said that your culture the west the people of europe the people of north america that you guys live in he said for that we have the same word that we use for a tangled fish in there for us this part of the brain is just for problem solving don't live in there all the time and like you're saying about that 25 percent of the blood flow is in there you know it's literally it's living you know we're lighting that part of the brain up so much of this much of these techniques what it's helping you to do it's not like uh it's not a cerebral and intellectual thing it's like because i was wondering when we were hanging out for example when there was that we went down to the river near where i live there was a man there in a canoe now i'm english so i see this man in the canoe oh no this man's there in a canoe he's going to see me and wim hof get into the water in our pants right and sure enough he's there eating his sandwich and hello good day to you and i like in the water you know with you and stuff and like the man leaves you do you have any time for thinking about social anxiety what other people think of you whether i know so when we met the farmer oliver and you went well goodbye oliver do you think about like uh these kind of things are they on your mind or have you lit up aspects of your brain mind consciousness to such an extent that social anxiety what other people think of you don't really register exactly um you know you're talking gut yeah the microbiome which we just showed that uh we found a relationship between microbiome and uh and the brain which is also the causing effect of say depression this is happening in the gut you're saying in the gut yes it's a microbiome deregulated through inflammation getting through the blood brain barrier but that's a a little aspect it's interesting because many of these things that the spiritual community takes for uh like believes is true and the say scientific or atheistic community say no this is not true they these things are true and can be proven by science but there typically is no appetite to demonstrate that they are true one of my frustrations like you know i respect and love and i'm grateful that you speak primarily in scientific terms because science is obviously a massive part of the answer but when people present scientific findings as neutral i say well it's not entirely neutral because look at what the focus of science is science's objectives are capitalist objection objectives only studies that are taking place are the studies that are funded by organizations that ultimately want to commodify and commercialize their findings people aren't studying hey it looks like people can cure cancer by thinking and breathing differently no one's paying for that study no one wants that to happen so that is not neutral yeah it is and yeah you know and it's almost mammalian logic that people who are selling medicines and pills they don't want to to lose their clients no so go back to that thing you don't get embarrassed in front of the farmer then what did you feel what's in your mind when we see the farmer and when we see the canoeist you just what do you think oh yeah yeah yeah it's just a it's a bloody great day [Laughter] you're not neurotic you are not a neurotic man are you warm enough in here you want me to turn the temperature up you okay do you want a blanket yeah no yeah mother nature takes care of me the thing is yeah you know um there is three times more neural activity coming from our heart to our brain than vice versa but we keep on thinking in the western world and dominating our feelings we close it up we take 25 more blood flow in the neocortex all the time we don't know how to sleep or we get anxious i sleep like a rock every year last night i was up uh 3 uh 3 30 no three o'clock for one hour and done them there you wake up for an hour what do you do meditate yeah do you sit up no you stay laying down yeah contemplate and uh do conscious breathing do you ever have problem getting an erection oh no and i can tell you why because again it's an erection is an automatic process no like a typically they're like because i know that because in that no inhibitions there absolutely not and and and the professor with whom i work he tells doing these breathing techniques and going into the cold this way that uh uh makes the expression of the genomes in the dna responsible for virility really turned on so this could be a killer for the viagra business uh any time you know uh not only if you do this breathing as i uh yeah mentioned a little about it if you do this breathing then uh when you have been intimate with your uh a woman uh which is a nice way to say it intimate it could be anything a cup of tea is being intimate yes yes you've been very intimate with that one yes and uh so there are different ways of being intimate uh with uh your woman and when you have done you know and exhausted like uh you do 20 minutes of breathing you go again full on it's amazing just for that this podcast is already successful everybody is gonna love it not like it love it because we love that so not only look the most dutch person in uh history it's like everything that british people think of dutch people the kind of sort of permissive nurse the extreme nurse the sexuality you've taken it to the absolute pinnacle whim teach me some briefing right now show me some so i can demonstrate it all right um you got a clock here yes so get me the timer on you got it right i want you to go within two rounds up to two and a half minutes without air in your lungs no i can't do that i can't do yeah yeah only die and but then re-ink on it what if i don't come back as a guy with this haircut oh no so that's two minutes you have to just press start okay so tell me what to do let's do just one round and about two minutes without breathing you will stay okay and without a in your lungs okay and uh well the consequence of that all that is a is a is a chain reaction uh within the body into the deepest part of the brain uh the activation of the uh adrenal axis of getting into the brain stem and activate also the opioids and endocannabinoid system which is responsible for activating the immune system you reset your body to its primordial state that is what we are going to do but don't mind about it just do it jenny will you do the timing so wim doesn't have to worry about timing yes yeah come but we let's keep this is the podcast let's not do anything that we're just not losing any content because this is lovely okay so i'm ready to start now good luck so jenny just don't let it go off so okay so you're going to teach me this technique it's on two minutes oh and you can get it to two minutes 30 seconds no and normally we do this like four rounds in the morning it takes about 20 minutes so now we do one round about five minutes is gonna take okay this will be in anybody is able to do this along on a sofa or sitting safely like you are sitting uh now and or but don't do this in water don't do this behind a wheel of a car because you really get into past your conditioning past your uh consciousness you can go and there is nothing going on it's great what is going to happen your body becomes very alkaline which is just a newly been proven in a scientific research be going to be published very soon is a lot related to this how simple it is how many complications will go away if you only do this let's go right fully in let them go through the mouth huh mouth nose doesn't matter whatever you feel i do like this okay with your mind follow your breath go on go up fill up your belly your chest everything you got full here letting go fully letting go we will do 30 30 breaths we almost got 10. really end letting go relax fully in then you let go pull in letting go it's all all right fully in letting go here is the meditation here's the going deep even people meditating for years are not able to go as deep as we will go now and go go with the flow like the sea waves getting to the shore then letting go and there it comes again julie letting go 17. boolean letting go fully letting go pull here letting go you feel light in your head losing your body tingling it's all all right breathe into it breathe into it intensify whatever you feel is different we are charging up the body we want to go into the depth we are charging up the body yes 23 seven more fully in let it go fully air letting go fully air [Music] boolean one here comes the last one boolean let him go and stop after the exhalation just witness feel the feeling the rush it's your blood in your nervous system charges there is no need for breathing whatsoever it's no hypnotizing just the magic of the physiology at work now we are your body your nervous system is getting into the brain stem slowly and surely oxygen levels begin to decrease rapidly does the brain brainstem is beginning to answer hey there is no oxygen but you are alkaline your chemistry is right so there is no need for breathing but the crocodile doesn't understand he says i have to survive adrenaline shoots out you get a reset to your primordial state wherein the immune system suddenly is within the reach of the will and it's happening all what is not necessary in the body the wrong cells cancer cells half cells it is being expelled because you need to be in function a danger happening the body goes into this autonomic nervous system state of being to be the best of yourself and you are doing it all consciously you are at ease this is the way we get into the deepest and take over control in the neurological pathways right over there blood flow is going into the depth into all the parts of the brain any brain scan is able to tell that so there it is okay breathe in at breathe in and hold and squeeze to your head 10 seconds 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 two one let it go that is one round now this is what these people did in the hospital and then the bacteria had no chance how simple it is and when we are dealing with inflammation causing depression in the end we take away the inflammation with doing this within a quarter of an hour and people feel re-revived of their depression and depressed state so it's a it's a cure for anything because we are built to be able to prevent and heal from disease both physical and mentally and this is the way and possibly as you said in the beginning um i've been entering into these different yogic states and getting knowledge from the ether or wherever it is because this is the what they want to bring in into the world and it can be experimented and tested meticulously through scientific scrutiny and comparative research that it is simple to enter back on with our contemporary mind into the depth of our beings of our brain our mind our spirit our soul anything is over there when we're doing the exercise if your commentary was right on it i felt like uh oh that is the part the part where you feel like oh god i've got to breathe i've got to breathe like there's a moment where something powerful impulse fear fear it and so fear is adrenaline i suppose what we mentally label as fear that must be us registered the deepest part of the brain part of it is hippocampus it's a storage of fear trauma and all those things they are being you learn to control them within 10 minutes we did one round yeah second round you would have gone two and a half minutes without in the lungs you get even deeper more blood flow gets there and you will your neurological pathways they tap in yeah yeah this is fantastic what i notice about the state afterwards i'm a person that has quite a lot of you know my um narrativizing mind is very active i think a lot i think a lot of words you know i think a lot of thoughts yes this is maybe also the elevation of intellect you become sharper when i faster speed of light yes yes in that state though the uh i there was some cessation like afterwards there was a like a for me it was a slower you know like i feel now i feel sort of suspended pretty peaceful slow down yeah yeah and seeing it speed of light yes because we are light the nervous system electricity is electricity system and we go within that system and activate it into the deepest thus it cleanses us everything that we categorize we categorize everything according to our animal experience time itself the way we see time is categorized because our understanding of the cycles of the sun and the cycles of the earth and the cycles of the season but time itself there's no objective actual quality and it seems that through accessing different parts of the consciousness we can change the way we relate to time we can change the way we relate to disease we can change the way we relate to one another that mostly what civilization osho once said civilization is a clearing in the forest you know all of our systems all of our cities all of our laws all of our beliefs just a dent in nature and if you alter consciousness itself at the level of the individual let alone at their level of tribes and cultures and systems then we can formulate different laws different relationships when i see the the political debate takes place within very narrow parameters we should regulate this we should fund this we shouldn't do that for me this feels like a very small conversation brexit don't brexit trump don't trump for me it's like well this is a tiny molecule of the conversation and what we need to access is a transcendent different realm about the way we organize our cultures more truthfully in alignment with who we are as individuals and who we are as societies if it's possible to find different ways of sharing resources let's use those if it's possible to find different ways of healing our bodies let's use them it's actually a very practical system that i would advocate for rather than continually advocating for systems that retain power in a very narrow bandwidth of our social systems almost anything you look at as a problem in the world today whether it's ecological meltdown medical meltdown bad food being proliferated it's because for someone it's not a problem for someone it's beneficial ecological meltdown not a problem for halliburton uh food the diet of the american or anglophonic world not a problem for the industries that control it the level of heart disease cancer not a problem for the people that produce the drugs exactly solve those problems we can no longer trust this system we have to learn to transcend the way we are schooled and the way we are able to use our brain which is 20 percent before it wasn't not too much the matter because the industrialization and all was not at that big scale that refined and control to make money and to control our minds of uh how to make more and to make more money so that is only the last 200 years or something and now it's really embedded in psychological control over the people i say okay i don't mind what you guys all do hey you want to make money i understand but i want to have hundred percent control over my mind no because i don't trust you guys anymore so i found a way to tap into the brain and to find a way to go past this conditioned mind and there suddenly i find there are ways to heal myself there are ways to pass it on to anybody else there are ways to deal with depression and mental disorders there are ways to get more energy out of myself i own my own mind and i'm showing this to others hey own your own mind it's possible we got millions of data that we are so conditioned through hundreds and years of stealth and being uh brainwashed in in certain ways that is serving a system our schooling is serving a system wherein we get careers and all that it's not necessarily serving happiness strength and health so it was the dave asprey in this podcast he asked me whim well i never asked this question what do you think of enlightenment and uh please put it in one sentence all bibles and qurans written on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so i i i i i came with the oh i got it just be happy strong and healthy and the rest is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the way we are defending and carrying we are not light but dark we are not light but heavy that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] needs to go and ask yourself every morning uh are you happy strong and healthy are you going for your dream vision are you going for your state of your your subconscious are you learning how to make full usage of your own mind so the spirit is able to grow and your soul is able to shine like the sun and it's there because the rest is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you don't i think most people don't believe that it is possible to be happy i think most people don't believe it i think most people think this is life i mean if you think about uh some of the philosophical ideas that govern the cultures that we are from you know life is suffering uh you have to work hard you know like these kind of like people don't most of the people i talk to don't think oh it's possible to live a blissful life free from tyranny i got i got it this morning i had to talk with my son about this ainum your son who is here with us managing this situation brilliantly responding to your constant demands for photographs yeah yeah yeah a lot more yeah what did you say logistically is doing everything around me yeah uh i i was not into anything i had uh uh uh had to pay the taxes i'm not into paper so i had a guilt with the taxes and uh and then he came along he built it uh built this format of this website and all in into it but this morning we had a discussion and this this called you cannot say that everybody wants to be happiness because there is no light without the dark you got to experience some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shitty moments to appreciate the feelings which are so uplifting and elevating and nice and great i said absolutely i do agree because yes i do i do uh uh there because what what i say is we found the compelling evidence of the key components of the autonomous processes inside the brain related to mood regulation and that mood regulation emotion is i found ways to regulate that at will consciously for those in need and for and who are the ones who need it people who are depressed or having bipolar issues or psychosis schizophrenia anxiety fear ptsd trauma all those things the real terrorists of our mind we are able to regulate guys it's there we found the ways to tap into the brain and take over the control when is necessary for the rest the life let it be very very colorful that's a really beautiful message let me make sure that i've asked you everything that i need to it's been amazing hanging out with you but i i would like to understand before we go let me understand before we go like can you connect with the person that you were before you had access to this information can you remember living a life where you didn't have this zeal where you didn't have this certainty can you remember feeling like oh god i'm depressed today oh yeah i mean i came from these valleys depression and all i know those won't i lost my wife in 95 she jumped from eight story down jesus christ i mean uh and he is my oldest son there is the oldest son he was a he was 11 at a at a time and the youngest was like seven years younger this is our imaginable pain you lost your wife they left them broken-hearted and you know what she was she had schizophrenia yeah as they called it and they put all kinds of injections into her and anti-depressives and she only got worse so that is my burden that is my start of my journey deeply within to seek solace to seek solutions i wasn't aware of that i was only brokenhearted and having little money and have four kids to bring them up uh by myself and no wife around me i mean the the love of my life beautiful lady very lusty in life and beautiful she was beautiful look look at him there's a an answer for a guy handsome young man and i got three more man and i i got two daughters and two sons and they are all very handsome and pretty and this and that she was very pretty and very alive but then this terrorist in the mind and then a regular healthcare with all their knowledge all the doctors ships and professorships and whatever they got in knowledge it just got worse and she jumped she gave it a kiss to to the little babies before she went she was very conscious of what it was it was a real terrorist a real terror and that terror now we are able to tackle i found as a drop out of school in my uh in my journey since then uh finding a and a looking into nature yeah the cold brought me stillness in in my mind the breathing brought stillness like control over the emotion and then i came i did uh many records and then the scientific world came to me and they began to experiment and now i have come in connection with the psychiatrists in the world and the best top researchers on the dna the best ones as a drop out of school and i'm showing them how to go and tap into the deepest part of the brain and to learn to re-regulate anything that deals with our mood which means uh depression psychosis bipolar schizophrenia uh trauma fear uh anxiety yes so anything of those we are able to tackle this is my message it comes from a broken heart and now it is full circle we got the knowledge it came from nature and nature has the answers whereas the books are failing and the system is failing and we got this message now for you and this is my podcast with you you go also very fast past all the perceived limits and the conditioned mind within this system you are a true seeker and thus we find true findings and this is one this is good stuff thanks wim hof thank you what about how did you may say i feel that we have established that you have discovered something that is very powerful i feel that we uh established that this is something that can be conveyed to other people that it's not just an anomaly a quirk it's something that we can all learn and we can perhaps think about how to make this information accessible and simple and useful to a number of people with all sorts of different abilities and all sorts of different challenges it's interesting for me to think about the moment of inception being one of loss and pain and the sort of ordinary tragedy of losing somebody to suicide and manic depression or schizophrenia schizophrenia how then prior to these techniques did you survive as a father how did you deal with grieving children how do you deal with that how did you deal with that what was the process yeah with the grieving children i was just being with them we but the children made me survive nature healed me that it is you you can't think you gotta be i remember uh every weekend uh uh uh after the uh during the night uh they came to my bed and we slept all the five together like a nest and a a very it closes it's naturally that it closes that it becomes a nest again a place of safety and without thinking you just do it you are simply there for them 100 and the loss later i began to work on my broken heart but there was no time of dealing with the broken heart uh or the theme because the four children are very demanding but beautifully also because they don't let you think too much about your source and your grief also it seems that for me that you instinctively use thought as most people understand it merely as a means to communicate and articulate deeper experiences even when we were in the river and i was in the river i was cold you know i'm telling you right okay i'm cold now you're saying uh like i was expecting you're gonna say right breathe in through the right nostril block the left nostril now exhale through the mouth now hold pull the uh mulabanda tighten ariana banda i was thinking oh it's gonna be like you know very prescriptive but you said instead no just be in the cold be in the cold and then let your body do what their body is able to do and like in this moment i uh recognize that you know like because i said to you also what shall i do where should i put the attention don't put it nowhere nowhere don't put the attention nowhere other things i remember from this brief experience uh when we were doing the is that tai chi we were doing on the show what were we doing oh no it just came up with that you came up with that improvised tai chi actually i don't know what that was i was just actually around once i had no toilet and i had to do my poopie so i had to stand in this awkward position they call it a horse stance the sheena banda the thing is i lately did it for three hours a uh barefoot in the snow and you know what in three days i do it with anybody in the snow barefoot standing in that awkward uh horse uh stance yes yes which activates the adrenal axis so when did you know that it actuates the drain when you go into the culture you learn [Laughter] it's interesting mythically uh like in uh mythology the acknowledgment that to discover the truth of who you are you need to go into the belly of the beast you need to go under the ocean you need to go into the darkness into the pain that's where you will discover the true gift of the self if you never go below the surface if you never go under the skin then you will never discover the truth of who you are you will only vibrate on the higher frequencies so for you the cold has become your teacher you have become the the yogi of the cold from the cold you've discovered deep truths now um yeah the other thing when you're throwing the stick from my dog bear and you say rouse rouse which i guess is a dutch word for lost let it go let it go let me throw this stick on the talk listen i guess ah he speaks dutch universal yeah it's universal yeah so it's um for me it seems what one of the things that i am understanding is uh that underneath the physical and material reality there is a truer realm which we can access through techniques and if we access it we can change ourselves if we never try to access it and the first point of not accessing it is to not believe it's there if you like there is no ulterior realm there's only this there's only what can be measured there is only the material world that means you are never going to investigate you are never going to have what you described as the most important ingredient the curiosity the curiosity that yes maybe it's possible another ingredient the faith and the optimism that i think it is possible to be happy i think it is possible to be strong when you have these beliefs then you can investigate with faith the possibility to become a different person which you must have needed a lot of when confronted with the loss of your children's mother you must have needed faith hope curiosity and then you can fall into nature because what i felt at that moment in that in that river was oh what i'm i'm not going to be because i have a facility for thought for fast thinking uh but they're often there are situations you cannot think your way out of there you just have to be you just have to be and let go and be in the cold water and then other energies that are not at the frequency of fast frenetic cerebral activity are able to be accessed yes i mean they will after this and if you go regularly into the the cold shower uh a cold shower a day uh it keeps the doctor away it we will even become better at it do you think i will win um yeah i'm doubting now no you will man i think that's a really fantastic podcast i i've really enjoyed the experience of getting in the war of playing with the dog of hanging out in our pants doing what i thought was tai chi but it's actually something you were making up on the side of a river just two guys standing in pants moving about i hope people will enjoy the video footage we'll have to we'll have to release that i'm very interested in your continued exploration of these techniques and i would like to help you in popularizing them and communicating them in a way that's accessible in music that that is great i think you're a great man in bringing uh complicated matters to the people and with that the awareness and with that physical awareness and physical ability to deal with uh things like emotions and uh and faith let's have faith back again that we are able to regulate our own happiness strength and health it's all about that guys and it's there we got all the evidence and we are in popular rising uh together with this man and with this man and we are just two blokes bringing something very complicated in very simple ways to you because it's there because we love you all right wim hof thank you very much for coming on under the skin right on fantastic yeah great great right we paused for we thought the podcast was over there but then we kept talking and wim said this which was very interesting which i wanted to include in the podcast so there was a little gap and then he said this there must be uh consciousness prior to mata you know not oh yeah there is yeah metaphysically dynamically the it uh big bang that's the most stupid thing uh in the world existence uh that it all began with the big bang what are you talking about it's a big thought of the universe or what and and then life like we are began there is a there is a uh there is simply a a matter which we are not able to measure with the devices we have yes yes yes yes yes yes and that gets into matter and when that matter comes then we are able to work with our consciousness on that matter to bring it back to that state wherein it was and now release it to get back into that state and there is the soul there is the beautiful soul which is immortal and indestructible there we find a relief of the fear and the concept of what is death yes and it and that should become physical and now we have the devices to show uh by dna research and big microscopes etc how the metaphysics and how the metadynamics work before while it goes into matter and when it is released it's like a telephone it's a body and when your telephone is kaput your information your consciousness is still in the icloud it's it's not dependent on our body but with our body we are able to do what those people who are passed away were not able to do and they passed away and their codes their consciousness is encrypted in our genome expressions and now we have found a way to tap in and to clarify and thus we do the breathing i bring the people with their consciousness inside and at a certain moment people begin to yell there isn't that strange thing like two days ago with 800 people are you ready to do this in the round house or something yeah that thing that looks like a hangpan i use by the way very good in uh playing the impact it's nice oh yeah oh yeah yeah that thing that pan that's beautiful that thing i know that yeah so well you were there and you hear people have like uh sort of speaking in tongues type experiences yes yeah yeah yeah gloss like spirits captured spirits are very much related to physical genome expressions our genetical codes or for the past generations are like captivated spirits those spirits have lived and they left a certain kind of genome expression which is embedded in a in the passage through the sperm into our little new conception and there goes to the light and it grows into a baby and it has certain kinds of dna uh inscriptions we are able being alive to tap in into the genome expression it's not only epigenetics i go a level beyond i mean in a sense as you said before it's an entirely new paradigm that's accessible when i listen to this it makes me think that all these billions of years of history and evolution uh is merely the expression of a conscious force realizing itself as matter until that until its inaugural consciousness can be once again re-accessed and it feels like we're almost at that point even though it's a time that seems culturally and socially defined by a certain kind of darkness surely this consciousness knows how to realize itself through us the light will prevail will prevail nice one man thanks for listening i hope you enjoyed that episode with wim remember don't try any of those techniques in bloody water you lunatics it's dangerous go and look at his website and learn about it properly like i have done and have since become a very very powerful fella next week we're going to be listening to teresa chung she's a spiritualist she's a wise woman she's going to bring some much needed feminine power to this podcast i'm very excited for you to hear her she was a wonderful person to meet she wrote some fantastic books about mysticism and it was very enjoyable talking with her in the meantime you have a listen to some old ones jack monroe adam curtis fern cotton janice vera farkas they've all been on so check them remember i'm doing those live shows at the moment come and see me go over russellbrand.com and uh mentors the audiobook's very good some made some mind listen to it they said they liked it anyway i love you thanks for listening stay with us bye thanks for watching this podcast and going all the way to the end of it because you should kind of click the bell might not be over there and uh subscribing so that we can infiltrate your serenity and peace of mind with jangling bells and buses thank you

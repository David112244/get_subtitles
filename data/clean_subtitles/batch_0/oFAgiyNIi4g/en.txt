new split jerks I don't know his accident conditioning or joining in but I think I'm gonna join Sun NC up hills it's made my day yeah and send it to the why [Laughter] there's a lot of banter between us when we train some would almost say it's slight bullying it's made basically sunny and Zach bully me in Leon for being lesser humans I just pushed push jerk and split jerk and Stanley's response was oh wow it was like 95 pillows to take from that what you will is taking a piss there's a moment right when I catch it I bring it out and do a quarter shoulder press just to get a little more activation in the triceps no down because this Friday we're gonna get the bro muscles in us a double dip in 12 or balls 10 burpees every minute on the minute 10 minutes I said 12 and 12 tonight all

beat you in a handstand sprint so today Zach you know I think we're all gonna jump in we're gonna have a handstand competition both sprint and I'm gonna crush him I have a slight suspicion that you boys at Thirsty's I ordered one drink I've got four right now how I think that I thought you don't bit of a guar if this is busy we're leaving all right hang on you have a tickle in heart they're not even big tablet yeah I know it happens now how was your breakfast chaps all of them lied all of my hide it was the Leon's breakfast didn't come it was so he had to punish chakras instead and it was you it was just a very very old breakfast this morning yes exactly we got we know there's a really good place we've been before we got up a little bit late and we pay for it by not being prepared and I was prepared exactly he's trying to tell me is forum bigger than work this is my big one as well go this is an absolute highlight of my life for once sunny is the one so we start I'm just diagnose a slight grade one doc does that exact it's time before we start the different John has challenged me to a handstand walk and race always loses all three I'm Sunita when is it [Music] how do what they start got some fun funny yeah I'll start by just saying a massive thank you to everyone coming out today Sony's just kicking off fishing to start with some mobility stuff anything that's particularly useful to you guys and I think obviously a lot of it is but that I think is really good for you guys it's easy for me to get cross on camera I'll break it down for you guys because there will be some absolute bits of gold in here for most of us you got what it takes to become Superman that's about as flexible [Music] behind the excess breast let's get the reps how does your trip to the shop go it's long and tedious what you just missed on camera this just happened what did you buy caffeine there was no sandwiches or anything so Kathleen sweeties yeah I'm taking the bar yeah classic fizzy that's busy that said Leon just picked me up some caffeine in the form of this I'm not gonna lie so horrible this is horrible this is horrible I took one swing can this happen to my eyes [Music] that's a his core drill if you're struggling with your overhead squats and basically are out of position like you're kind of you can't stay upright you're leaning forward to your tight hip flexors Porter ass extension this is a really cool drool you can use that will lock you in position and kind of force you down and back into the hips you need to bit down and you need a rig and it's as simple as this [Music] and that will allow you to push into the rack to force yourself a bit into position and keep it nice and upright with overhead squat position if you got 20 minutes to work up to heavy snatch the first bit of work we've done today Superman aka Alex that's his first name Clark or Superman third name is Alex is in this naturally this I think he's pokeballs you've got 112 snatch once well [Music] yeah [Music] all the evolutions complete Superman's finally here [Music] so it worked up to 85 which is a really nice 85 actually and as always got to 90 and just kind of just let myself crumbled a little bit and I was going to work back up to it and in my need to start - engine and nerve pain I've had in it I got I would pain free when I start this monster stop there it's not worth it for me I can I can get naughty again any other time lunchtime off to find some food I'm full of gummy bears in Monster open the gift other way 1790 nutrition today has been appalling so hopefully sugar we can find some I want definitely on the downhill of a sugar yeah I want something you know I'd settle for even like like it's just a big chicken wrap or chicken salad all right this is what we can find what did you have I had a delicious Turkey and salad baguette but the dressing on baguette was phenomenal wasn't it I had a cheese and tomato sandwich and the filling was wonderful cold floor

four people they fight each other friends and very good then close acquaintances appear through a fight the most difficult o of hours in my life I had so many ideas there I took flags with me to climb where no one else had climbed Well everyone always has them Well in Yakutia in the cold always have a bottle with you everyone went out had a little fight I like it yes I like the visualization works to she writes to me Duma now money or what But ask locked himself behind the counter then I fell in love and everything is in front of you Boris Medvedev fighter of the Arkhangel team Mikhail with a record of 17:2 from a series of nine victories in the last fight Boris knocked out Gleyson Kiba and is now waiting for a visa to the USA to get into the UFC in our interview Medvedev told several funny stories How he worked as a security guard in a nightclub and ran away from the police froze in -64 near a broken UAZ and 1100 climbed Elbrus how fans dissuaded him from participating in oklo football fights and the future wife wrote first and then forbade him to act micro there are rumors that you will be the next fighter in the UFC Well, a signed Russian fighter in the UFC And can you explain in detail where these rumors came from and what is your status in the UFC And there is no status yet in fact, but you need to get a visa we will do a visa there and then we will see in the ranking I am in a good position, so I think the organization will be interested in me, that is, you have contracts with the UFC No, you just get a visa and then start of course of course and there What circles, so to speak, of hell will you need to go through to get a contract so we will act Well, are you ready to break through through the contender Yes, of course, just through the contender people who apply to the UFC They get a not very big contract, like there is a minimum if you are offered in the UFC much less than in the RCC what will you choose no big deal are you ready to start there Yes this is my goal why You said that you want to destroy the top-1 of the UFC which of the top-1 do you want to be the first to destroy Well, we still have to get to the top 15, probably  it is necessary and so probably yes I don't know yes in fact who will be given the main thing now The most important thing is not to think about the top 15 but to think about the fact that they will give a visa And in general well in Zaire so that they are interested to subscribe now what is the most important and so I train in the working mode everything is fine Well if you get into you in 77 will tsia Yes of course here is a common opinion that UFC fighters are just a different level and fighters who are not in the UFC are inferior in level And when you watched the fights of this division 77 did you not have the feeling that some people well it is generally unclear why they are there from the top 15 No probably did not arise But from the division Yes sometimes you watch and think he got there at all can you give some one name No I don't know the names exactly I won't give the names exactly but it happens at tournaments It happens at tournaments you watch and think How did he even report there It's just that when I watch, for example, Rick's fights I still don't understand exactly how he wins for me he is an amazing character no clan is a tactical tactical machine  who acts with great intelligence he controls the station well breaks through series and constantly attacks you it is very difficult to fight when the opponent is constantly standing next to you and there is a threat in his blows it makes you nervous Are you a master of sports in boxing Yes Who has the coolest boxing of the fighters of those you have seen about probably Bieber Tumenov is fighting in ISE now He has good boxing UFC champion in your spring edr which is not very high so I rate all the champion of Bela Yaroslav Osov Well and so it is considered that the BC is equal to the champion of one of these two organizations the best welterweight in the world Who in your opinion is better in preference Probably because of his pace of the fight he constantly he constantly fights does not get tired he has good control at the bottom I think Er would not have coped with Conn a long time ago in this in fact there at 77 they have been sawing this weight already here there are four of them they are fighting with each other So far no one has appeared in the media higher than them that is why they are dividing these lines I donâ€™t really know who will win but they prefer Edwards you are in one  from the interview he said that your favorite fights are RZ Why exactly them Well probably Cody Cody was not probably probably not Cody Cody No this But Jon Jones Yes Cody was on the move then and fought great he is so impulsive great to do Well and Jon Jones is of course the king of all kings you were surprised how easily he passed Gana oh no No in fact I was not surprised at all That is, you exactly expected that J well no well no maybe not like that I may not have expected it so easily But I knew Well I knew without a doubt that he would pass him what are your thoughts before the fight Jones with a sword Jones will take I don't know Everything is there everything for this Jones hits fights he is very dangerous At close range What can surprise him Miocic with wrestling boxing I think no it's just such a common thought that MCh is already in health and in downtime he will not cope with Jones It seems to me even if I was very young he would not have coped with Jones Well it's just my opinion a few questions about your biography you were born  in the city of the ring in Yakutia at what temperature do they cancel classes in schools Oh yeah right now School doesn't go Oh what is it called up to the third grade elementary school p Chana not It at 45 45 doesn't go and high school students at 50 don't go and often they do n't go Yes they turn a blind eye to this In general, so Well once a year they can not let the school in everything else at 55 you go normally yes the faster you go the better Here you were in one and told that you left for the competition in a UAZ broke down and ran around the Lazik and the temperature was mi 64 If I remember correctly it was on the Leni River we broke down were warming up I was about 16 there was a coach Dostoy Well everyone always has a bottle of vodka with them in Yakutia in the cold everyone just got out vodka the coach began to feel and warm up actions as to warm up here I read about such stories That in Yakutia the distances are large and between one settlement and another there is sometimes nothing at all and very  rarely drive a car that is in fact a critical situation you break down Frost and you can stay there yes yes you can not wait for anyone at all absolutely still Hilly terrain enough and trucks even if they pass by they will see you but they will not stop because they do not want to because then they will not go up if they stop here in the lowland then they will not go up Yes who who saved you then and in the end the driver fixed the car somehow did something with the computer it finally started and that's it we went and how long did you stand like that Yes I don't remember well about 40 minutes an hour probably but I remember that the oil boiler under the engine I was talking about it hands and at one point it became cold that is the car just remained and what were the thoughts then Well I understand like 16 years old anyway you perceive it cheerfully everything thoughts were Well thoughts probably like a child maybe it's worth running where Well forward but about two kilometers one way two kilometers the other there is nothing just emptiness Taiga Well first water and then the Taiga will begin everything that is that  because you listen to the coach listen to the coach wait Yes, as the elder says, so you do it, what in principle represents yourself as Rin Gri That is, I looked at Google maps like this, a small town of Taiga, a coal mine, what else is there, yes, it will be, in my opinion, all gold, gold, nearby, there is a city of Aldan, gold, mo, they wash gas, they found oil, there is a small developing city. It is somehow at GAZ, now they found oil, oil, gas, they are engaged there. Well, when you Rosto is such a mining town, a mining town Yes, Yakut coal was there before, then the sword was sold and the city began to fade a little. From the south-east, Nikita Krylov and Italy Slipenko told that, in fact, childhood was spent in constant cancers because, well, from one small town they go somewhere to another, from one area to another, and there is always Makhach because someone drove in the wrong direction. What kind of childhood did you have? My childhood was in the gym, I was especially especially there on the street, not a conflict, that's why. And you weighed then there is 40 kilograms 42 kg 4642 kg I performed school home school home training school home training and so on endlessly here just Shara Bulit told that he also in childhood was a red-haired without a beard and says I looked very cute and they tried to test themselves on me constantly like now it is very easy to beat him and then he fought back and Everyone was surprised That is, you weighed 42 they did not approach you there they were small now they did not go Well, there were some situations We were children that there was a fight nothing well that's it nothing special you said grandfather told you that you can test confidence by shaking your fist so that the fist rings What other advice from grandfather Do you remember that it really stuck Oh yes, I remember everything about grandfather grandfather grandfather read me books I listened to him We had like this a certain connection here is the fashion he was like that and he was my friend and then a general that is in general he yes very very much influenced my life very much You said he was excellent at boxing at boxing Yes I saw VL boxing not far from home went to KNU looked  and then I came to my grandfather I say grandfather Take me there there we will go I understood he took the coach there we will talk about these underground underground Soviet karate No he was always in shape he was 80 years old he was such a stone straight dry every morning gymnastics there dousing with water in general a strong man you said that when you were doing boxing you crossed paths with Dmitry Bil And how was it you just saw him there you trained together No we are almost the same age we just crossed paths somewhere at competitions At training camps that is well I personally don't know Dmitry but I just saw him Yes about champions Usually they say opposite opinions nothing gave away a champion in him and I immediately understood that he was a future champion When you looked at B what was your opinion To be honest there was no opinion then Dmitry Bil then fought in amateurs and in amateurs As I understand it then things didn't go very well for them somewhere in the end they started to get hooked somewhere maybe with a coach just in professional boxing and now they are all who were involved in amateur boxing  boxing is often said that there is such an atmosphere at competitions And what about you, let's say, if you are not destined to win, then you will not win Tell me how No, well, commercial commercial Yes, situations somewhere sponsors there and something else, but amateur boxing is generally subject to this, to judge in one to one box office, you can win against an opponent, but in the end, his hand will be raised and no one does anything about it Well, now, somehow, I watch amateur boxing now I like the way they judge And in general, the approach That is, before, well, they simply judged you, the rules of the game are like that Well, yes, there is nothing to complain about, or what, it happens that Nare is a pony I reach And then I am screwed No, well, there is no such thing, but it's just that at the moment, somewhere, somewhere, maybe an equal fight, judges I don't know, I am not a judge myself, so I don't know how they regard it Well, yes, there is such a thing in amateur boxing, it's debatable You said that in your time you worked as a pizza delivery man and a security guard in a nightclub, which brought in more money Yes, and there and there I hear a little Zar, a logical question about security in  night clubs How often did conflicts arise Yes, I'm not particularly conflict-prone, I'm a stress-resistant person, so somewhere I had to take a girlfriend out there, nothing more, that's just Vitaly Snko also worked in the VM club, he said that this work pumps up stvo, stability, sociability, me, People read, that is, what serious intentions he has there or not, that is, he said that they put a knife to him there. He doesn't see by a person, like, this one won't do anything to me, he talked him into it in the end. There's just a bro, friends, and so on. What did working in a nightclub pump up in you? Yes, I don't know, it probably didn't pump up anything, only she, we probably pumped up our nerves somewhere, pulled them like steel ropes, they became Yes, it's all this, it's all alcohol, alcohol, drunk people. Therefore, it's better to better keep away and hold on, just so many professional fighters have worked in a nightclub that it seems to me Well, you know, there is a basic wrestler, a basic Drummer, a basic security guard, 100% in general, Well, did you have a story that you with got into a fight with someone in a nightclub Then you ran away from the police and then drank tea Tell me about it in detail yes yes so you went out fought a little then ran together ran away met became a good guy talked great after the fight eh it often happens to me and at school it was like that friends friends and very good then close acquaintances appear through a fight fought then once and just why if you are a security guard in a nightclub you specifically run away from the police if in fact you are like preventing and I no no I didn't work then no no I didn't work I just was and you mentioned that you stopped boxing because of some injury for 2 years I think you had a break And what happened so Well I had a traumatic brain injury eh the doctors forbade me to practice Well and how would I myself in general just well it was hard for me it was at competitions or something like that in everyday life No not like that on the street Yeah You trained for some time at the club sech Pro with a football player while saying that on  glade Didn't fight And how did they not drag you out And I I wanted I wanted to fight but I have such an older friend Dima who Well in every possible way protects me himself one signed he says no need just you don't need this Why And you were just burning Well I wanted it so much yeah Cool And for whom could you fight if Well those were the mobile phones they were from the mobile that's from Rona I heard the story of your husband with his wife she wrote to you on Instagram first I understand he has such a bright instag and that's when they write like that Well there is a possibility that It's just a scam At what point did you realize that I won't demand money from you everything will be fine re Yes not almost immediately I wrote to her invited her to a fight I had a fight right that very day or that day I invited her she came that's why we met Well you were just surprised like in fact really came Yes yes I think what kind of scam who what she is on me what she writes to me Duma now where will they ask for money Duma Well and then they just reported calm down yes Yes yes then then I fell in love and that's it you  said that he wrote more precisely on Instagram that only your personal nutritionist helps to drive weight that's how I watch the fighters and still Well there is such a feeling that some do not quite understand How to drive weight there How to lose it and so on That she first of all forbade you to eat there or said this is completely wrong That's how things are Well probably for the Armed Forces sweet prof in fact nutritionist She understands not only diets and how to drain water preparation Completely All in all preparations She understands pr a real professional she in addition to athletes leads a lot of people and seven right whole families leads people somewhere helps someone get pregnant and really really does not work out very much you ca n't do Oh yeah, everything is simple Why can't I eat dough and meat for example well in the quantities that I want Why can't I order pizza and eat it all that is Yes I need a little bit Eat a piece there then another Eat there yes there were many different moments but now in fact thanks to her I got on such already I don't  from fight to fight I go on a diet and I already have such a balanced diet and this has already become my way of life That is, I will not go there to eat some burgers or some fast food just because I already understand all this and I do not need it Wikipedia writes that you are into meditation Why do you need meditation Oh well Attitude for today for today and setting a goal for yourself really but Who would like to think people who have achieved something they know that visualization works so yes when you think about something and really want it really badly you want it will definitely happen just people who are not into meditation look at people who are meditating A person sits with his eyes closed What happens to health in his life for the VS what I want to achieve I think about it I definitely set goals I visualize how it is how I will be there how I will be there before a fight for example standing or in a fight I will already be how they will raise my hand all this works that is just such a thought process I often ask myself the question what I will do today to get closer to  championship to become the best in your sport And in the evening before going to bed I ask myself again what I did, what I did today and I answer the question to myself What did I do Did I stand there longer than everyone else Did I work not five rounds like everyone else And did I do six more than everyone else A It happens that you think you did nothing a bad day And that also happens Such days also happen And you, you analyze it, write it down and then do not make such mistakes Yes, you wrote that you climbed Elbrus And those were the most difficult 11 hours in your life How exactly Yes, those were the most difficult 11 hours in my life Well, somehow it was What is it It was very difficult We left at 9:00 pm at 8:00 am we went to Elbrus to the Peak I just got up and wanted to record some kind of video Well, in general, I had so many ideas there I took flags with me I wanted to settle the gorilla flag there and the Archangel In general, I had a whole lot of preparation there I had for this thought but up there when I climbed I was completely devastated I started writing something down, tears started to flow I just ca n't express it But you Ustasha I just want to Quickly Quickly just drop all this and just go down and not climb a second time oh no no no a second time probably I'll probably go to the mountains But when I'm 45 probably then I'll go to the mountains But no I read about climbing Everest that well it seems like it looks cool there climbed Everest But in fact, when Lipini sy climb they see firstly a huge amount of garbage and secondly a lot of uncleaned bodies for those who did n't make it like on Elbrus with this on Elbrus with this well there are a couple of places with an oblique shelf when you go there there is That's what it's called this trpo collection there are cracks there is a sharp cliff and you go there without insurance without anything I don't know why they are there well they still have n't thrown ropes so that somewhere there well in general there is a glacier down there and there are cracks of 300 m that is there are already even  they are not looking for here I raised and I had Ascension and in 2 days from Krasnodar Or where the guy in Sobr even in my opinion or Mammon works somewhere worked he was walking back and slipped there tripped and fell There in this true collection That's what it's called and before you raise Elbrus there is no such instruction that if something happens to you there, most likely no one will help you Yes Yes Well when you sign the contract Yes there is such a pile of documents and there you need to sign on three sides, that is, all responsibility is on you in case there if not there no one for you Yes you will not bear responsibility you go in a group That is, if you if you feel bad and you fall and roll somewhere then Well rolled rolled the group goes on And I understand The same There was a case when you were snowboarding and almost flew off Sochi yes that is, you like extreme sports I like it yes I like it that is, as if there is not enough adrenaline, they just say extreme sports lovers SPO No no  that there is not enough adrenaline Well Well yes probably somewhere somewhere and so yes somewhere it is not enough somewhere you want to want to climb climb where no one has climbed before last question You said that you are not against women's fights Although the overwhelming majority of fighters probably say like well we don't want to watch that there are girls fighting [ __ ] each other Why are you not against Oh yes sometimes fights in my opinion are better  what about the guys rolling up Well, at least I don't know how it is in the post-Soviet space Well, I do n't really watch women's fights, but in the best League in the world, when fights take place, when women fight, the same Shevchenko, for example Well, just for the viewers to watch the technique, how it works, it's cool Ronda Rousey Yes, there are many, many who can roll up such fights
